Adefarati was at some point the State Commissioner for Works and Transport (between 19791983). Adefarati was also a prominent member of the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) a leading organization in the fight against the military during the General Sani Abacha days. Political intrigues and high wire politics which culminated in his alienation from many of his erstwhile comrades, major backers and the leading lights of his administration namely Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, Late Chief Rufus Giwa, Dr. Akerele Adu, Dr. Olu Agunloye, Chief Yele Omogunwa, Senator Nimbe Farunkanmi, Dr. Awolowo Ajaka, Dr. Tayo Dairo, Chief Niyi Omodara, Mr. Tunji Ariyo, Chief Jise Akinmurele, Chief Bamidele Awosika, Col. Akin Falaye (Rtd.) amongst others dealt a fatal blow to his second term bid and sealed the victory of Dr. Olusegun Agagu at the polls in April 2003. These people claimed dissillusionment with his administration while some claimed lack of transparency in the selection process adopted by the Alliance for Democracy in the selection of its gubernatorial candidate at that election.The relationship of Chief Adebayo Adefarati with Pa.

Adefarati was governor of Ondo State from 1999 to 2003 before he was defeated when he ran for re-election in 2003. He was however not cowed as he later was a presidential candidate for the Alliance for Democracy party in the April 2007 presidential election, but died in Owo, Ondo State at the age of 76 of an undisclosed ailment a few weeks before the election. He had not been considered a major candidate, but his death raised the possibility that the election would be delayed.

136767	Agent	This web page is under construction, since its subject A.D. Bruno takes an active part in its fabrication.Mathematician Bruno, Alexander Dmitrievich (Russian:   ) made substantial contribution to the normal forms theory. Bruno developed a new level of Mathematical Analysis and called it "Power Geometry". He also applied it for solution of several difficult problems in Mathematics, Mechanics, Celestial Mechanics, and Hydrodynamics. Traditional differential calculus is effective for linear and quasilinear problems. It is less effective for essentially nonlinear problems. A linear problem is the first approximation to a quasilinear problem. Usually a linear problem is solved by methods of functional analysis, then the solution to the quasilinear problem is found as a perturbation of the solution to the linear problem. For an essentially nonlinear problem, we need to isolate its first approximations, to find their solutions, and to construct perturbations of these solutions. This is what Power Geometry (PG) is aimed at. For equations and systems of equations (algebraic, ordinary differential, and partial differential), PG allows to compute asymptotic forms of solutions as well as asymptotic and local expansions of solutions at infinity and at any singularity of the equations (including boundary layers and singular perturbations). Elements of plane PG were proposed by I. Newton for an algebraic equation (1680); and by  Briot (18171882) and  Bouquet (18191895) for an ordinary differential equation (1856). Space PG was proposed by A.D. Bruno for a nonlinear autonomous system of ODEs. However, one should be very careful in taking these assertions at face value. For example, V.I. Arnold, and I.M. Gelfand considered PG useless.Bruno is the inventor and founder of The Universal Nonlinear Analysis (UNA). UNA is a new level of Calculus beyond ordinary mathematical analysis and functional analysis. UNA supersedes and surpasses them on many levels. UNA is based on PG, which is a very powerful tool for "Asymptotic Solving" of all nonlinear problems. In fact, for the last 30 years Bruno is trying to find a problem that he could not solve. He has not succeeded yet in this endeavor, but he keeps trying.Meanwhile, he continues to develop PG as a New Calculus. The Space PG was invented by Bruno in 1962, but only recently he managed to upgraded PG to itsthree-dimensional version (3DPG).Bruno is among 500 of the most influential people of the last century. He has a diploma to prove it (in fact, he has 6 of them). The diploma cost him a mere $5000 US dollars, and it was worth every penny. With the diploma came a book where he and other most influential people are listed. You'll have to consult Bruno for their names.His motto: All is shit except urine  (it is published in that book with the diploma).Thus Bruno managed to reduce all mathematical functions to just two bodily functions.His favorite saying: Thinking is detrimental to your health  (it was a banner spanned across his cabinet for 10 years).It should be noted that Bruno is a healthy person for his age. Bruno is very active and, despite his age, keeps up with modern trends in science. For example, he invented Nano-mathematics (it is a branch of mathematics where PG actually works, that's why it's called Nano), and he is familiar with Idempotent and with Tropical mathematics. He also knows several people who know computer algebra.

158708	Species	The Alveolinidae is a family of spheroidal to fusiform milioline foraminfera with multiple apertures and complex interiors in which chambers are subdivided into chamberlets and subfloors interconnected by passageways. As with all Miliolina, the test wall in alveolinids is porecelaneous and imperforate. In living individuals the pseudopodea emerge through the multiple apertures that line the apertural or leading face of the test. Alveolinids first appeared near the beginning of the Late Cretaceous, about 100 million years ago, some 150 million years after the superficially similar fusulinds went extinct at the end of the Permian.Irregular coiling is found in the first volutions in the microspheric forms of most genera, indicating a close relationship with the Miliolidae. Alveolinella is an exception as the proloculus in the microspheric form is perforate and the first volutions are peneroplid in character, suggesting it, Alveolinella, may have a different origin than the other alveolinids.

172031	Eukaryote,Species	Ananas is a plant genus of the Bromeliad family (Bromeliaceae), native to South America and Central America. It is best known for the species Ananas comosus, the pineapple.This genus originated in Mesoamerica and was brought to the Caribbean Islands by the Carib natives. The oldest register with the representation of the fruit seems to be included in the Cascajal Block, attributed to the Olmec civilization.In 1493, Christopher Columbus first saw plants of this genus in Guadeloupe. It was brought from Brazil to Europe by the Portuguese, and from there was distributed to the Pacific Islands by the Spanish and the English. Commercial pineapple plantations were established in Hawaii, the Philippines, Southeast Asia, Florida and Cuba. The pineapple has become one of the world's most popular fruits.The tough leaves grow in large rosettes, arising basally from a crown. These leaves are long and lanceolate with a serrate or thorny margin. The flowers, arising from the heart of the rosette, each have their own sepals. They grow into a compact head on a short, robust stalk. The sepals become fleshy and juicy and develop into the well-known complex form of the pseudocarp fruit, crowned by a rosette of leaves.Ananas species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Batrachedra comosae, which feeds exclusively on A. comosus.The word Ananas is derived from the Guarani name for the pineapple, via Portuguese. In most languages, pineapple is called "ananas".

Dubbed the Vicar of Bray of politics, he was the only Soviet politician who managed to remain at the highest levels of power within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as that power oscillated between the Central Committee and the Politburo, from the latter days of Lenin's rule, throughout the eras of Stalin and Khrushchev, until his peaceful retirement after the first months of Brezhnev's rule.Mikoyan became an early convert to the Bolshevik cause. Mikoyan was a strong supporter of Stalin during the immediate post-Lenin years. During Stalin's rule, Mikoyan held several high governmental posts, including that of Minister of Foreign Trade. By the end of Stalin's rule, Mikoyan began to lose favour with him. In 1949, Mikoyan lost his long-standing post of foreign trade minister. At the 19th Party Congress Stalin even attacked Mikoyan viciously. When Stalin died in 1953, Mikoyan again took a leading role in policy-making. He backed Khrushchev and his de-Stalinization policy, and became First Deputy Premier under Khrushchev. Mikoyan's position under Khrushchev made him the second most powerful figure in the Soviet Union at the time.Mikoyan made several key trips to communist Cuba and to the United States, acquiring an important stature on the international diplomatic scene, especially with his skill in exercising soft power to further Soviet interests. In 1964 Khrushchev was forced to step down in a coup that brought Brezhnev to power.

188451	Other	Anglesite is a lead sulfate mineral with the chemical formula PbSO4. It occurs as an oxidation product of primary lead sulfide ore, galena. Anglesite occurs as prismatic orthorhombic crystals and earthy masses, and is isomorphous with barite and celestine. It contains 74% of lead by mass and therefore has a high specific gravity of 6.3. Color is white or gray with pale yellow streaks. It may be dark gray if impure.It was first recognized as a mineral species by William Withering in 1783, who discovered it in the Parys copper-mine in Anglesey; the name anglesite, from this locality, was given by F. S. Beudant in 1832. The crystals from Anglesey, which were formerly found abundantly on a matrix of dull limonite, are small in size and simple in form, being usually bounded by four faces of a prism and four faces of a dome; they are brownish-yellow in colour owing to a stain of limonite. Crystals from some other localities, notably from Monteponi (it) in Sardinia, are transparent and colourless, possessed of a brilliant adamantine lustre, and usually modified by numerous bright faces. The variety of combinations and habits presented by the crystals is very extensive, nearly two hundred distinct forms being figured by V. von Lang in his monograph of the species; without measurement of the angles the crystals are frequently difficult to decipher. There are distinct cleavages parallel to the faces of the prism (110) and the basal plane (001), but these are not so well developed as in the isomorphous minerals barite and celestite.Anglesite is a mineral of secondary origin, having been formed by the oxidation of galena in the upper parts of mineral lodes where these have been affected by weathering processes. At Monteponi the crystals encrust cavities in glistening granular galena; and from Leadhills, in Scotland, pseudomorphs of anglesite after galena are known. At most localities it is found as isolated crystals in the lead-bearing lodes, but at some places, in Australia and Mexico, it occurs as large masses, and is then mined as an ore of lead.
189886	Work	Animated Stories from the Bible is a video series produced by Nest Family Entertainment and Rich Animation Studios.The series is non-sectarian and features twelve beloved stories from the Hebrew Bible.   The episodes have been reviewed by an Advisory Board including Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein (Founder of the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews), Nathan Hatch (president of Wake Forest University and previously provost of the University of Notre Dame), Reg Grant (professor of pastoral ministries of the Dallas Theological Seminary) and Christian apologist, Ed Decker.Unlike other animated series based on Bible stories, these programs are not based on modern characters interacting with Biblical figures, but rather provide dramatic retelling of the Bible stories themselves.  The series was created to be a non-sectarian informative and educational tool to help parents, caregivers, and educators instill positive spiritual values and character traits to those in their care.Originally released directly to video, the movies are now available on DVD.  Nest Learning distributes the programs and several of the episodes are now on a limited broadcast run on Trinity Broadcasting Network and BYUtv.Over the years supplementary learning materials have been added to the series designed to help develop core curriculum knowledge and skills, while building positive character traits.  They are used in Christian churches across denominations, Jewish Community Centers, and by countless home educators and families.  In addition, public schools and libraries use them in comparative religion curricula.The individual programs within the series have earned multiple awards and endorsements including the family approved seal from the Dove Foundation, The Parent's Choice Foundation award, the "Award of Excellence" from the Film Advisory Board, the Director's Choice Award from Early Childhood News, KIDS FIRST!, and received the highest rating from the Practical Homeschooling Magazine.The series was directed by Richard Rich, the ex-Disney director who also directed The Swan Princess trilogy, and other animated educational programs such as the Animated Hero Classics and the K10C: Kids' Ten Commandments.

200807	Eukaryote,Species	Anthozoa is a  class within the phylum Cnidaria. Unlike other cnidarians, anthozoans do not have a medusa stage in their development. Instead, they release sperm and eggs that form a planula, which attaches to some substrate on which the cnidarian grows. Some anthozoans can also reproduce asexually through budding. More than 6,100 species have been described.The name comes from the Greek words  (anthos; "flower") and  (zoa; "animals"), hence  (anthozoa) = "flower animals", a reference to the floral appearance of their perennial polyp stage.
203002	Agent	Anton Rolandsson Martin (3 August 1729 at Mijntenhoff Manor, Reval30 January 1785 in Abo) was a Swedish botanist.He was son of Roland Martin, who later became an appeals court judge, and was born when the family was visiting friends in current Estonia. In the mid-1730s, the family moved to Abo in present-day Finland, as the father received a position as secretary at the appeals court (hovratt) there. Martin was enrolled at Royal Academy of Abo in 1745, where he spent time as musician and a music teacher, while at the same time doing botanical excursions and discovering several plants previously unknown in Finland.He worked as a tutor in Stockholm 1753-1756. After coming into contact with Pehr Wargentin, the permanent secretary of Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and presenting some papers to the academy, he was enrolled as an apprentice student at the academy in 1756. He also enrolled at Uppsala University 1756, and received a bachelor's degree in medicine in Uppsala 1761.In Uppsala, Carl Linnaeus was teaching, and he was sufficiently impressed with Martin to select him to travel with a whaling ship to collect specimen from the Arctic region and become a pioneering Arctic researcher. In April 1758, Martin left Gothenburg on a whaling ship belonging to the Swedish Greenland Company. The three-month trip went as far north as the 80th parallel, encountered difficult weather conditions, and Martin was only ashore for a few hours, on some small islands to the west of Spitsbergen. The trip did however produce valuable weather observations, and collections of sea-living animals and birds. In 1760, he did a trip to Norway's west coast, and did collections of sea-living animals using Bergen as a base. He also studied causes of leper and migrations of herring.In 1761, after his degree in medicine, he moved to Stockholm intending to finish his education and at the same time practice as a physician. In the autumn he became ill, and after months of pain he was forced have his right leg amputated after it had been attacked by gangrene. He thereafter abandoned his plans for a higher degree, and in 1763 went to Finland, where he lived on small means in different cities but from 1770 in Abo, receiving some financial support from friends. He continued to make scientific observations and experiments, in particular relating to physiology.

He studied at the School of Arts and Crafts in Barcelona. At that time he made several drawings with wax, sand and other types of clays or even scrap, incorporating other waste materials found on the streets.His bigger and last artwork was a big mural done at Vallgorguina, 10 x 2 meters.

203629	Agent	Antonina Makarova (nee Parfenova, Ginsburg by marriage, Russian:  , 1921  11 August 1978) was a Soviet war criminal and executioner who collaborated with the Nazis during World War II. From 1942 to 1943 she executed some 1,500 Soviet partisans and their family members by machine gun. Makarova was caught by the KGB in 1976 and executed two years later.Antonina Makarova was born in a small village in Smolensk Governorate as Antonina Parfenova. On her first day at school, Parfenova's name was written down as Makarova, from her father's first name, Makar, as the shy girl had forgot her last name. Makarova studied later at Moscow and when the war broke out she joined the Red Army as a volunteer nurse. Makarova also took courses to learn how to use a machine gun.In Autumn 1941, Makarova was separated from her troops. Three months later, in January 1942, she was recruited by the local authorities at the town of Lokot, which was the capital of the Lokot Autonomy. Makarova was hired as a machine gun shooter. Her job was to execute Russian POWs and partisans including their families. Usually Makarova was ordered to execute a group of 27 people, which was the number of prisoners the local jailhouse could hold. In the evenings Makarova spent time with German officers along with local women who were working as prostitutes. In the summer of 1943 Germans found out that Makarova and the other women had sexually transmitted disease and they were sent to a hospital.As the Red Army entered the Lokot region they found remains of about 1,500 people whom Antonina had executed. Soviet troops captured and killed many Nazi collaborators, but Makarova, who was at a remote hospital, was not among them. In 1945, Makarova married a Russian war veteran named Viktor Ginsburg. They settled in Lepiel, a town in Soviet Belarus, and had two daughters. Antonina and her husband lived as respected citizens enjoying all the privileges granted to war veterans.The KGB kept the case open for many years but could not find the right Antonina Makarova. In 1976, a KGB official named Parfenov was registering some documents of his relatives in order to get a visa. He found out that everyone in his family had the last name Parfenov save one: a woman named Antonina Makarova (Ginsburg after marriage). She was later recognized by several witnesses who had known Makarova during the war. The KGB arrested Makarova and the court sentenced her to capital punishment. Antonina Makarova was executed by shooting on 11 August 1978.

211646	Location	The Arabian Desert is located in Western Asia. It is a vast desert wilderness stretching from Yemen to the Persian Gulf and Oman to Jordan and Iraq. It occupies most of the Arabian Peninsula, with an area of 2,330,000 square kilometers (900,000 sq mi). At its center is the Rub'al-Khali, one of the largest continuous bodies of sand in the world.Gazelles, oryx, sand cats, and spiny-tailed lizards are just some of the desert-adapted species that survive in this extreme environment, which features everything from red dunes to deadly quicksand. The climate is mostly dry (the major part receives around 100 mm of rain per year but some very rare places receives down to 50 mm), and temperatures oscillate between very high heat and seasonal night time freezes. It is part of the Deserts and xeric shrublands biome and the Palearctic ecozone.This ecoregion holds little biodiversity, although a few endemic plants grow here. Many species, such as the striped hyena, jackal and honey badger have become extinct in this area due to hunting, human encroachment and habitat destruction. Other species have been successfully re-introduced, such as the sand gazelle, and are protected at a number of reserves. Overgrazing by livestock, off-road driving, and human destruction of habitat are the main threats to this desert ecoregion.

Big Star became widely known through 80s reissues and the long delayed first release of Third/Sister Lovers, recorded in 1974.The label was revived in the 1990s with two divisions:  Alternative Mainstream and Contemporary Christian.  Former Big Star guitarist Alex Chilton released recordings on the Ardent mainstream division, which also released recordings by bands such as Spot, Jolene, Two Minutes Hate, The Idlewilds, Neighborhood Texture Jam, and Techno-Squid Eats Parliament.  The mainstream division of Ardent Records was closed in the mid-1990s. Ardent's Christian label issued its first Christian releases in 1995.

216775	Agent	Aretas IV Philopatris (Haritat in Nabataean) was the King of the Nabataeans from roughly 9 BCE to CE 40.Aretas came to power after the assassination of Obodas III, who was apparently poisoned. Josephus says that he was originally named Aeneas, but took "Aretas" as his throne name. An inscription from Petra suggests that he may have been a member of the royal family, as a descendent of Malichus I.His full title, as given in the inscriptions, was "Aretas, King of the Nabataeans, Friend of his People." Being the most powerful neighbour of Judea, he frequently took part in the state affairs of that country, and was influential in shaping the destiny of its rulers. While on not particularly good terms with Rome and though it was only after great hesitation that Augustus recognized him as king, nevertheless he took part in the expedition of Varus against the Jews in the year 4 BCE, and placed a considerable army at the disposal of the Roman general.Aretas had two wives. The first was Huldu to whom he was already married when he became king. Her profile was featured on Nabataean coins until CE 16. After a gap of a few years the face of his second wife, Shaqilath, began appearing on the coins.

241023	Location,Place	The Athens State Hospital Cow Barn is a historic agricultural building on the grounds of the former state hospital in Athens, Ohio, United States.  One of several agricultural buildings associated with the hospital, it has been named a historic site.The Athens State Hospital was founded in 1874, pursuant to legislation enacted seven years prior.  Within three years, the hospital was contracting with a local blacksmith to buy milk from his dairy, but by the early twentieth century, this arrangement had proven inconvenient, and in 1912 the hospital bought the farm associated with the dairy operation.  Two years later, the present cow barn was erected near the old farmhouse.  This was a time of expansion for the hospital complex, which retains numerous buildings from the beginning of the twentieth century; like much of the rest of the hospital, the cow barn displays Colonial Revival architectural influences, unlike the substantially older farmhouse next door.  The barn itself is a linear concrete building with some shingles on the walls, a concrete foundation, and a slate-covered gambrel roof.  Three towers are placed on the roofline, while dormer windows pierce the lower part of the roof at regular intervals.  A prominent entryway is set in the middle of the long side of the building, with six window-filled bays to each side.In 1978, the old cow barn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its place in local history and because of its historically significant architecture.  Two years later, much of the state hospital complex was designated a historic district and listed on the Register, but the cow barn was not included, as it lies 0.5 miles (0.80 km) away from the rest of the complex.  No longer in agricultural use, the barn has been converted into an art gallery, the Dairy Barn Arts Center.

The short prose tale of a comic character is the one French literary product the pre-eminence and perfection of which it is impossible to dispute, and the prose tale first appears to advantage in the Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles."Antoine de la Sale is supposed to have been the "acteur" in the collection of the licentious stories. One only of the stories is given in his name, but he is credited with the compilation of the whole, for which Louis XI was long held responsible. A completed copy of this was presented to the Duke of Burgundy at Dijon in 1462.The stories give a curious glimpses of life in the 15th century, providing a genuine view of the social condition of the nobility and the middle classes. M. Lenient, a French critic, says: "Generally the incidents and personages belong to the bourgeoisee; there is nothing chivalric, nothing wonderful; no dreamy lovers, romantic dames, fairies, or enchanters. Noble dames, bourgeois, nuns, knights, merchants, monks, and peasants mutually dupe each other. The lord deceives the miller's wife by imposing on her simplicity, and the miller retaliates in much the same manner. The shepherd marries the knight's sister, and the nobleman is not over scandalized. The vices of the monks are depicted in half a score tales, and the seducers are punished with a severity not always in proportion to the offence."

It is 40 metres long, 15 metres wide, and has a tower that stretches 25 metres high. Inside there is a sculpture of Saint Michael with a demon at his feet that was made with only one piece of wood, and the interior paint makes it appear as though it were marble.The patron saint days celebrated at this Church include the Our Lady of Grace on the 8th of September and Saint Michael the Archangel on the 29th of September.It was declared a National Monument by the Chilean government 27 July 1984. It is one of the 16 Churches of Chiloe that were declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites on 30 November 2000.The Church began a process of restoration in January 2012.  The architect of the restoration was Katerine Araya, and the head carpenter is Simon Carcamo.The Church is considered an exemplar of Chiloes traditional architecture. The Church that stands today is not the original one, because it was rebuilt in 1879.  Construction was completed in 1895.When the restoration of the Church commenced and the foundation was examined, the architects team found bone fragments and skulls under the foundation of the Church. The Council of National Monuments was informed. Araya affirmed that the findings would be treated according to the Law of National Monuments which has stipulations for archeological findings.The decision to remove the cupola of the Church generated controversy. Also the cypress and larch woods are unavailable, so the rotting wood will be replaced with other, more common woods, which is generating controversy among residents. As much of the original wood will be reused, however.  The problem occurs because of the constant rains in Chiloe.

524502	Work,WrittenWork	Collar the Lot! How Britain Interned & Expelled its Wartime Refugees is a book by Peter Gillman and Leni Gillman. It is a detailed account of British internment policy during the Second World War.At first, the British government took a relaxed attitude to the tens of thousands of "enemy aliens", most of them refugees who had found sanctuary in Britain from the Nazis.  But a panic following the fall of France and the invasion scare in May/June 1940 led to a mass round-up of most Germans in Britain, pro- and anti-Nazi alike. When Italy joined the war thousands of Italians were rounded up too, irrespective of their political allegiances or how long they had lived in Britain. It was at this time that Winston Churchill, so the cabinet minutes record, issued the order:  "Collar the Lot!"MI5 was supposed to be making sensible assessments but in fact contributed to the panic and misjudgment. The authors show that both the Home Office and the Foreign Office took a more liberal line, and would have preferred to allow most of the refugees to remain free.The book also records the tragic tale of the Arandora Star, in which 1500 internees were being deported to Canada. It was sunk by a German U-boat and two-thirds of those on board were drowned. The authors interviewed survivors in Britain, the US, and Australia. Many of them were deported again on a second liner, the Dunera; this time heading for Australia. During the voyage the Dunera narrowly survived another U-boat attack. There were two more deportation voyages to Canada before the outcry over the Arandora Star led the British government to revise its policy. From that point on, the internees were gradually released from their holding camps in Britain, leaving only a hard core of confirmed Nazis and Fascists.The book won very favourable reviews when it was published, and became the standard reference source on that topic, until the issue was reopened twenty years later.

526215	Other	The Colony class frigates were a class of 21 ships constructed in the United States by Walsh-Kaiser of Providence, Rhode Island for transfer under Lend-Lease to the Royal Navy in 1944. They were given the names of relatively minor colonies as names of large colonies had been used for the Crown Colony class cruisers.The ships were built as United States Navy Tacoma-class patrol frigates, a design that was an adaptation of the Royal Navy River-class frigate, with modifications made mainly to use materials and parts more readily available in the United States.  For example, American 3-inch (76 mm) guns were used as the main surface armament in the Tacoma- and Colony-class frigates instead of the British 4-inch (100 mm) guns of the River class. They were mass-produced to mercantile standards to enable their speedy construction in shipyards that did not normally build warships. They were built more quickly than British shipyards could build the Rivers, but the quicker build required more man-hours and sterling cost was about twice that of a River. Upon transfer to the Royal Navy, each ship underwent modifications to bring her in line with Royal Navy requirements.Uniquely among the Colony-class frigates, and indeed among all World War II frigates, HMS Caicos was fitted and used as an aircraft detection frigate, stationed in the North Sea to detect V-1 flying bombs targeted against Great Britain. The other 20 ships served on patrol and convoy escort duties during the latter part of World War II. The ships are mentioned in HM Frigate by Nicholas Monsarrat, a very slim volume published under wartime censorship rules.Post-war, the Royal Navy returned one of the ships to the U.S. Navy in 1945 and the rest during 1946. None saw U.S. Navy service. Two of the ships were sold into mercantile service in Egypt, surviving until 1956, and Caicos was sold to Argentina in 1947 and served in the Argentine Navy until 1969. The United States scrapped the rest between 1947 and 1949, as they were considered inferior to destroyer escorts, which the U.S. Navy had in ample numbers, in every aspect except range.

530048	ArchitecturalStructure,Location,Place,Other	Community Christian Church was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and sits across from the Country Club Plaza's main shopping district on Main Street at East 46th Street in Kansas City, Missouri.In April 1940, members of the church congregation contracted Wright and asked him to design a new building to replace their previous church which had been destroyed in a fire. Wright based his design on a parallelogram including some features previously conceived for his last building for Johnson Wax Company, along with one additional unique feature: a spire of light. Due to high building costs, the scale of the church was reduced during construction. The auditorium was cut back from a planned 1,200 seats to 900 seats, many details were eliminated, and the building was sheathed in gunite, a form of lightweight concrete, over Wright's objections. The spire of light also could not be built and illuminated due to technical limitations of the times. However, the church was dedicated on January 4, 1942 and served the congregation well.In 1994, the Spire of Light was finally completed as planned. The components are housed on the church roof inside of a perforated dome on the building's northwestern corner. The spire is created by four (4) 16" xenon bulbs ignited by 40,000 volts of electricity, that, in combination with a parabolic reflector, produces 300 million candlepower of illumination (per light, 1.2 billion cp total) in a near perfect column. The spire can be seen for miles around Kansas City, and reportedly can be spotted 10 miles (16 km) north of the Plaza, depending on conditions. It has been calculated to stop at least 3 miles (4.8 km) up above the earth, about half the maximum height at which jet airplanes fly. The spire of light is lit regularly on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays; has extended hours on holidays; and remains dark on the two days before Easter. Its lighting is one of the features of the annual Plaza lighting ceremony.Tours of Community Christian Church are open to the public and free of charge.

532727	ArchitecturalStructure,Location,Place,Other	Congregation B'nai Israel is a Reform Jewish synagogue located in Bridgeport, Connecticut. It is the oldest Jewish congregation in Bridgeport and the third oldest in Connecticut.B'nai Israel was established by a group of German Jewish immigrants as an Orthodox synagogue in 1859. The congregation's first rabbi was A. Jacobs. B'nai Israel established a Hebrew school in 1863.For its first fifty years, B'nai Israel did not have a permanent home. Its members met and prayed in one another's homes and in storefronts and lofts. In 1885, plans were made to erect a building for B'nai Israel. The building, which was completed in 1911, was known as the Park Avenue Temple.By 1911, when the Park Avenue Temple was completed, B'nai Israel had moved from Orthodox to Reform Judaism. Members who were unhappy with the changes left B'nai Israel and founded two of Bridgeport's other synagogues: Adath Israel (Orthodox) and Rodeph Sholom (Conservative).After World War II, B'nai Israel outgrew its building and a second structure, called the Second Park Avenue Temple, was erected, designed by the prolific synagogue architect Percival Goodman. Goodman commissioned artist Larry Rivers to create a Torah ark cloth for the new building, but Rivers' design was ultimately rejected and his work ended up in the collection of the Jewish Museum in New York City.In 2002, the temple drew attention (including an article in The New York Times) after its large junior choir, directed by Cantor Sheri Blum, recorded a CD with Cantor Bruce Benson entitled The Rock Service, Featuring Cantor Bruce Benson and the Jazz Service. This album was described as combining "original rock music with liturgically accurate chants," and was reportedly in contention for a Grammy nomination. (Benson, later the cantor at Congregation Beth Israel (Scottsdale, Arizona), also recorded a jazz service with Kenny G.)In 2009 the temple, having recently renovated and expanded its building, celebrated its 150th anniversary. As of 2009, 700 families belong to Congregation B'nai Israel and approximately 400 students are enrolled in its religious school.

685513	Agent	Eachmarcach O Cathain (aka Echlin O'Cahan or Ackland Kane), Irish harper and composer, 1720-1790).O Cathain was born at Drogheda in 1720, and was taught to play the harp by Cornelius Lyons, harper to the Earl of Antrim. He travelled to Rome and played before Prince Charles Edward Stuart there. He then visited France, and went on to Madrid, where he played to the Irish gentlemen living at that court, who praised him to the king.But his uproarious habits did not suit Spanish decorum, and he had to walk to Bilbao with his harp on his back. After returning to Ireland he went to Scotland, and there made many journeys from house to house. Sir Alexander MacDonald in Skye gave him a silver harp-key, long in the family, and originally left by his kinsman and fellow harper,  Ruaidri Dall O Cathain (died 1653).The gift is mentioned by Boswell in the `Tour to the Hebrides.' O'Kane played all the old native airs, as well as the treble and bass parts of Corelli's correnti in concert with other music.Captain Francis O'Neill remarked of him:"His behavior was not at all times so exemplary, for Mr. Gunn relates that the Highland gentry occasionally found it necessary to repress his turbulence by clipping his nails; thereby putting him out of business for a time.""His execution and proficiency were a credit to his teacher, Cornelius Lyons, harper to the Earl of Antrim. Manini often spoke of him at Cambridge with rapture, as being able though blind, to play with accuracy and great effect the fine treble and bass parts of many of Corellis concerts, in concert with other music. Had he been but moderately correct in his conduct he might with certainty have raised the character of the wandering minstrel higher than it had stood for a century before."

697011	Agent	Edith Laura Urch (c.1915January 1978), known to her friends as Urchie, was an English nurse and charity worker who founded the Ladyeholme Housing Association, a charity for homeless people, and ran it as general secretary until her death.Urch was born in Russia, although her parents were both from Somerset. Her father, Reginald Urch, was Professor of English at the University of Moscow. Shortly after the Russian Revolution in 1917, her father was arrested and incarcerated in the Lubyanka Prison, and she and her mother hid in a tiny peasant cottage just outside the city. Eventually, in 1920, her father was released, and the family returned to England. She remembered her experiences of poverty in Russia all her life, and these contributed to her founding of Ladyeholme. Her father later returned to the area as Russian and Baltic correspondent of The Times, based in Riga, Latvia.Urch was educated in England and France and then joined the Poor Clares as a postulant. However, she decided that her vocation was in nursing and left the order (although she remained a deeply devout Roman Catholic all her life), qualifying as a State Registered Nurse and later also as a State Certified Midwife. She eventually rose to become sister-tutor at the Charing Cross Hospital in London.During the Second World War, she suffered severe spinal injuries during an air raid, which left her partially disabled and often in great pain for the rest of her life. In 1951, using her disability pension, she bought a small terraced house in Battersea and began to take in homeless people. This developed into Ladyeholme (the name coming from an historical association devoted to the Virgin Mary), which eventually had use of 42 houses throughout London. These houses had generally been purchased by public authorities, such as the Department of Transport or the GLC, for road schemes or other public works and Ladyeholme was able to use them to house the homeless pending final definition. The charity was always short of money, and Urch often lived in poverty herself at her home/office in Warwick Way, London, SW1, giving everything she had to it. She was often in conflict with Shelter, a much larger charity for the homeless, whom she accused of including the families housed by Ladyeholme in its own statistics and of claiming that it was the only charity helping the homeless in London, ignoring the existence of Ladyeholme. The charity relied extensively on voluntary work, often coming from Church connections. In the end Ladyeholme failed to endure because her tremendous drive, was not matched by high quality governance.

716513	Agent,Athlete,Person	Elise "Lee" Harney (July 22, 1924  November 1, 1989) was a female pitcher who played from 1943 through 1947 in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. She batted and threw right-handed.A native of Franklin County, Illinois, Elise Harney became one of the sixty founding members of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. While at school, she made her mark as a fast-pitch softball hurler in Chicago before joining the league. However, she ended her career prematurely after developing a sore pitching arm while trying to adapt to a new pitching motion in 1947.The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was a circuit that began to operate in the early 1940s in cities located on or near Lake Michigan. The main promoter was Philip K. Wrigley, owner of the Chicago Cubs, who worried about the viability of Major League Baseball players during World War II decided to establish an alternate attraction. Since the only organized ball for women in the country was softball, the league officials created a game which included both fast-pitch softball and baseball. Wrigley had scouts all over the United States, Canada and even Cuba signing girls for tryouts. About 500 girls attended the call. Of these, only 280 were invited to the final try-outs in Chicago where sixty were chosen to become the first girls to ever play professional baseball. The circuit was initially called the All-American Girls Softball League, though early in the first season the name was changed to All American Girl's Baseball League.  In its twelve years of history the AAGPBL evolved through many stages. These differences varied from the beginning of the league, progressively extending the length of the base paths and pitching distance and decreasing the size of the ball until the final year of play. For the first five years the circuit used a fastpitch underhand motion, shifted to sidearm in 1947, and never really became baseball until overhand pitching began in 1948. The inaugural season took place in 1943 with the teams Kenosha Comets, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox, and each team was made up of fifteen girls. Harney was allocated to the Kenosha Comets, a team managed by former big leaguer Josh Billings.In 1943, Harney joined a balanced Kenosha team that included players as very talented pitcher Helen Nicol, as well as Ann Harnett, Phyllis Koehn, Shirley Jameson, Pauline Pirok and Audrey Wagner, notably for their hitting abilities and strong defense. Harney relished her debut in the league, ending with a 1919 record for a .500 percentage, and posted a 2.93 earned run average while striking out 102 batters. Her teammate Nicol led the league in wins (31), ERA (1.81) and strikeouts (220), being honored Pitcher of the Year. Kenosha collected the third-best record at 5656, but won the second-half title and earned a ticket to the playoffs. The Comets were swept by Racine in three games during the first round. Inexplicably, Nicol failed in the playoffs and went 02 with a 4.50 ERA. Besides this, Harney also appeared in the league's first All-Star Game during the midseason, which was played under temporary lights at Wrigley Field, between two teams composed of Blue Sox and Peaches players versus Comets and Belles players. It was also the first night game ever played in the venerable ballpark (July 1, 1943).As a result of the success of the AAGPBL in its first year, civic groups in each of the four cities agreed to finance their own franchises. Then, the newly formed Milwaukee Chicks and Minneapolis Millerettes entered the league in 1944 and played their home games at American Association ball parks during the time periods the Milwaukee Brewers and Minneapolis Millers male teams were on road trips. As expected, the games schedule and frequent travels from one city to another increased significantly. Nevertheless, Harney went 1814 (.562) with 88 strikeouts and a 2.84 ERA. In comparison, her teammate Nicol slipped to 1711 (.608) but led the league with 0.93 ERA. The Comets, now managed by Marty McManus, again placed third (6254) and made the playoffs, this time thanks to a first-half title. Kenosha took a three-two advantage in the best-of-seven series against the expansion Chicks, but Nicol lost three of four pitching matchups with Connie Wisniewski, including a 21, 13 inning-duel, and finished 23 with a 1.09 in the finals.In 1945, Eddie Stumpf became the third different manager of Kenosha in three years, but the team suffered the worst season in franchise history. The Comets ended in last place with a 4169 record, 26 games out of the first spot in the league. In the collective debacle, Nicol (24) and Harney (14) earned 38 of the 41 victories of their team.But Harney developed arm and elbow problems after being overused in the previous seasons. She started 1946 with Kenosha and was traded to the expansion Fort Wayne Daisies during the midseason, compiling a collective record of 1020 in 33 appearances that year.In 1947 the new AAGPBL rules permitted a full sidearm pitching delivery, partly because the limited sidearm experiment of 1946 proved too difficult to enforce. Such change adversely affected many underhand pitchers who had problems adjusting to the new pitching style. Harney, for instance, injured again and opted to retire early in the season.Harney, who never left school while she was playing for Kenosha, graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1947. She is also part of the AAGPBL permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, opened in 1988, which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual player.

Emperor Dezong started out as a diligent and frugal emperor and he tried to reform the governmental finances by introducing new tax laws.  His attempts to destroy the powerful regional warlords and the subsequent mismanagement of those campaigns, however, resulted in a number of rebellions that nearly destroyed him and the Tang Dynasty.  After those events, he dealt cautiously with the regional governors, causing warlordism to become unchecked, and his trust of eunuchs caused the eunuchs' power to rise greatly.  He was also known for his paranoia about officials' wielding too much power, and late in his reign, he did not grant much authority to his chancellors.

It closely resembled modern flatfish, with an oval-shaped body about 10 centimetres (4 in) long, surrounded by elongated dorsal and anal fins. In the adult, the eyes were both located on the left side of the head, as in modern species, and the fish would have lain flat against the seafloor on its right side. This was an evolutionary advance from still earlier flatfish, such as Heteronectes, in which the eyes only partially migrated.

It exists naturally in the Philippines, tropical Asia, and the western Pacific, but for the commercial extraction of carrageenan it is usually cultivated. The species is commonly known as E. spinosum when cultivated and can be found in different colours: brown, green and red.Cultivation of Eucheuma started in the Philippines in the early 1970s and has since been introduced to many other locations with varying results. There are different methods of cultivating E. denticulatum. One of the more common ones is the off-bottom "tie-tie"-method, with the setup being two stakes driven into the sediment with a rope between them. Pieces of the seaweed are then tied to the rope at regular intervals and allowed to grow for 6 weeks, after which it is harvested and dried.The species was originally described in 1768 as Fucus denticulatus by Nicolaas Laurens Burman and in 1917 transferred to the genus Eucheuma by F.S.

768646	Work,Other	EyePet is a game for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, developed by London Studio and Playlogic Game Factory. The original PlayStation 3 version was released in Europe on 23 October 2009 and in Australia on 27 October 2009. This version of EyePet was originally scheduled to be released in North America on 17 November 2009, but was held back. Instead, a newer version of EyePet adapted for the PlayStation Move motion control system was released in North America on 5 September 2010, where it is available in a bundle. In October 2010, the Move-adapted version was released in Japan and Europe, with the European edition entitled EyePet Move Edition. The game also supports 3D on 3D enabled TVs. The PSP version of EyePet was released on 2 November 2010.The game uses the camera to allow a virtual pet to interact with people and objects in the real world. Using augmented reality, the simian, gremlin-like creature appears to be aware of its environment and surroundings and reacts to them accordingly. The player can place objects in front of the animal and the game will interpret what the object is and respond to it. For example, if the player rolls a ball towards it, it will jump out of the way to avoid being hurt. It will also react to the player's actions and sound allowing the user to, for example, tickle the animal or clap their hands to startle it. A trailer shown at E3 2009 shows the pet being customised with outfits and colored fur and interacting with virtual objects including a trampoline and bubble machine. The trailers also demonstrate users drawing custom objects (first trailer shows a car, E3 2009 trailer shows an airplane) which are scanned by the camera and converted to virtual objects which the pet can then interact with. The pet can also be fed, as in the trailers, it is shown eating cookies and a type of pet food.

Another war-film The Purple Heart followed, before Granger's naval service in Honolulu, in a unit that arranged troop entertainment in the Pacific. Here he made useful contacts, including Bob Hope, Betty Grable and Rita Hayworth. It was also where he discovered his bisexuality, which he said he never felt any need to conceal.In 1948, Hitchcock cast him in Rope, a fictionalized account of the Leopold and Loeb murder case, which earned mixed reviews, but much critical praise for Granger.

Granger described this as his happiest film-making experience, though he was deeply affected by his friend Walker's accidental drug-death soon afterwards.Granger continued to appear on stage, film and television well into his seventies.  His work ranged from classical drama on Broadway to several Italian-language films and major documentaries about Hollywood, but he tended to find fault with his directors and scriptwriters and he remains defined by the two Hitchcock classics.

787136	Agent,Person	Fyodor II Borisovich Godunov of Russia (Russian:  II ) (1589  10 June/20 June 1605) was a tsar of Russia (1605) during the Time of Troubles. He was born in Moscow, the son and successor to Boris Godunov. His mother Maria Grigorievna Skuratova-Belskaya was one of the daughters of Malyuta Skuratov, the infamous favourite of Ivan the Terrible.Physically robust and passionately beloved by his father, he received the best education available at that time, and from childhood was initiated into all the minutiae of government, besides sitting regularly in the council and receiving the foreign envoys. He seems also to have been remarkably and precociously intelligent, creating a map of Russia, which is still preserved. It was edited with some additions by Hessel Gerritsz in Amsterdam, in 1613, and reedited until 1665.On the sudden death of Boris the sixteen-year-old was proclaimed tsar (13 April 1605). Though his father had taken the precaution to surround him with powerful friends, he lived from the first moment of his reign in an atmosphere of treachery. On 11 June (N. S.) 1605 the envoys of False Dmitriy I arrived at Moscow to demand his removal, and the letters which they read publicly in Red Square decided his fate. A group of boyars, unwilling to swear allegiance to the new tsar, seized control of the Kremlin and arrested him.On 10/20 June Feodor was strangled in his apartment, together with his mother. Officially, he was declared to have been poisoned, but the Swedish diplomat Peter Petreius stated that the bodies, which had been on public display, showed traces of a violent struggle. Although aged 16 at best, Feodor was known to be physically strong and agile and apparently it took four men to overpower him.

790486	Agent,Organisation	Fianna Fail /fn fl/, also known as Fianna Fail, The Republican Party, is a centrist to centre-right and conservative political party in the Republic of Ireland. Originally an Irish republican party, it was founded on 23 March 1926 after a split in Sinn Fein on the issue of abstentionism. Fianna Fail's name is traditionally translated into English as Soldiers of Destiny, although a more accurate rendition would be Warriors of Fal ("Fal" being a legendary name for Ireland). Historically, Fianna Fail has been seen as to the left of Fine Gael and to the right of Sinn Fein and the Labour Party and is generally seen as a classic "catch all" populist party - representing a broad range of people from all social classes. Fianna Fail has led governments including parties of the centre-left (Labour and the Green Party) and of the centre-right (the now-defunct Progressive Democrats). It has been led by Micheal Martin since January 2011.From the formation of the first Fianna Fail government on 9 March 1932 until the election of 2011, the party was in power for 61 of 79 years. Its longest continuous period in office was 15 years and 11 months (March 1932February 1948). Its single longest period out of office, in that time, has been 4 years and 4 months (March 1973July 1977). Seven of the party's eight leaders have served as Taoiseach. It was the largest party in Dail Eireann at every general election from the 1932 general election until the 2011 general election, when it suffered the worst defeat of a sitting government in the history of the Irish state. This loss was described as "historic" in its proportions, and saw its electoral support base diminished by 75%, as a reaction to the intervention, and in the running of the Irish economy, by the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank in November 2010. After the February 2011 election, it moved from being the largest party to the third-largest party in the 31st Dail.Fianna Fail joined the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) party on 16 April 2009, and the party's MEPs sat in the ALDE Group during the 7th European Parliament term from June 2009 to 1 July 2014. The party is an observer affiliate of the Liberal International.The party is also organised in Northern Ireland but has yet to contest an election there.

862929	Agent	Geoffrey "Geoff" Willis (born 23 December 1959) is the Technology Director of the Mercedes Formula One team. He was also the Technical Director of Red Bull Racing team from 2007 to 2009 and Technical Director of Hispania Racing from 2010 to 2011.  In 1987 after a degree at Cambridge University in engineering, he was approached to join the design team of the Peter de Savary's British America's Cup challenge and he spent the next three years designing and developing hull and keel designs for the team in preparation for the competition in San Diego.  Prior to working for Honda, Willis was employed as chief aerodynamicist by the Williams Formula One team and also worked as a consultant at the Leyton House team in the early 1990s. While at Leyton House, Willis met Adrian Newey and it was through this association that he joined Williams, after Newey was recruited by the British team.  When Newey moved to rival McLaren in 1997, Willis was promoted, alongside Gavin Fisher, to take his role.Willis joined the British American Racing outfit in 2001, which was later bought by Honda in 2005.  His status within the team became unclear as of 22 June 2006, following the appointment of Shuhei Nakamoto as Senior Technical Director. Willis had been told to stop going to races in order to focus on aerodynamics, which appeared to conflict with the appointment of Mariano Alperin-Bruvera to head the aerodynamics group using Honda's new full-size wind tunnel.  Willis eventually left the team later in the year. On 17 July 2007, Willis was hired by Red Bull Racing as the team's Technical Director, once again under Newey. He left Red Bull in July 2009 for unknown reasons.Willis joined the new Hispania Racing F1 Team in March 2010. In September 2011 he left HRT, reportedly because the team hadn't assured him of necessary financial backing for designing the car for 2012 Formula One season and joined Mercedes as Technology director on 17 October 2011.

864662	Agent	George Alsop, an English author, was probably born in London in 1636; the year and place of his death are unknown. Very little about his life is known, except for what is mentioned in his book, which indicates that he was likely to have been born, and certainly spent some of his youth, in London, England.   Alsop is remembered for a significant work on colonial Maryland with a title unusually long even by the standards of the seventeenth century: A Character of the Province of Mary-Land, wherein is Described in four distinct Parts, (Viz.) I The Scituation, and plenty of the Province. II The Laws, Customs, and natural Demeanor of the Inhabitant. III The worst and best Usage of a Mary-Land Servant, opened in view. IV The Traffique and vendable Commodities of the Countrey. Also a small Treatise on the wilde and naked Indians (or Susquehanokes) of Mary-Land, their Customs, Manners, Absurdities, & Religion. Together with a Collection of Historical Letters.(London, 1666). After an obscure two-year apprenticeship he left London in 1658 due to a hatred for its local Puritans, according to his own account. Thomas Stockett, one of four brothers who arrived in Baltimore County, Maryland, cared for him as his indentured servant for two years. George Alsop appreciated the new colony, but at the end of his service to Thomas Stockett, he grew ill and returned to England. He then published his book, and may also have written a volume of Sermons, a work presented later by someone of the same name. In the work on Maryland, Alsop asserts that his design is to encourage European and English emigration to America. Alsop's eagerness to praise every aspect of Maryland makes his work a permanent record of the psychology of advertising. It also serves to a lesser extent as a reliable historical source of information for early Baltimore County, Maryland, and the then native Susquehannock.

898791	Other	In molecular biology, glycoside hydrolase family 20 is a family of glycoside hydrolases.Glycoside hydrolases EC 3.2.1. are a widespread group of enzymes that hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. A classification system for glycoside hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition of >100 different families. This classification is available on the CAZy(http://www.cazy.org/GH1.html) web site, and also discussed at CAZypedia, an online encyclopedia of carbohydrate active enzymes.Glycoside hydrolase family 20 CAZY GH_20 comprises enzymes with several known activities; beta-hexosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.52); lacto-N-biosidase (EC 3.2.1.140). Carbonyl oxygen of the C-2 acetamido group of the substrate acts as the catalytic nucleophile/base in this family of enzymes.In the brain and other tissues, beta-hexosaminidase A degrades GM2 gangliosides; specifically, the enzyme hydrolyses terminal non-reducing N-acetyl-D-hexosamine residues in N-acetyl-beta-D-hexosaminides. There are 3 forms of beta-hexosaminidase: hexosaminidase A is a trimer, with one alpha, one beta-A and one beta-B chain; hexosaminidase B is a tetramer of two beta-A and two beta-B chains; and hexosaminidase S is a homodimer of alpha chains.

This was after the previous promotional release, "The Edge of Glory", was made the third single from the album. Nevertheless, Gaga explained that "Hair" was not planned to be a single, but may be released as one if it sells well at the iTunes Store, like "The Edge of Glory".According to Lady Gaga, the melody of "Hair" resembles the work of metal bands Kiss and Iron Maiden, and is also influenced by Bruce Springsteen. The song is an uptempo club record inspired by Gaga's experience as a teenager, when her parents forced her to dress in a certain way. Gaga found that the only way to express herself was through her hair, and she described it as a song about liberation and her ability to change her ways. The lyrics talk about embracing one's hairstyle as their ultimate expression of freedom. "Hair" was recorded while Gaga was on tour with The Monster Ball throughout Europe. The song features a saxophone solo performed by saxophonist Clarence Clemons, a prominent member of The E Street Band. She personally wanted Clemons to play saxophone on the song, which he did by recording his part at a Manhattan studio at midnight, after he had just flown there from his home in Florida."Hair" has been critically appreciated for its message of self-liberation, individualism and empowerment, though some felt that the usage of the term hair to express these messages was not particularly new. "Hair" charted in most musical markets, reaching the top-ten in New Zealand and Scotland, while in other nations, it charted within the top-twenty, including the Billboard Hot 100 of the United States. Gaga performed the song on Good Morning America as part of their "Summer Concert Series", on Paul O'Grady Live in the United Kingdom, and on The Howard Stern Show.

It is called inflammatory because it frequently presents with symptoms resembling an inflammation. However it can present with very variable signs and symptoms, frequently without detectable tumors and therefore is often not detected by mammography or ultrasound.Typical presentation is rapid swelling, sometimes associated by skin changes (peau d'orange), and nipple retraction.  Other symptoms include rapid increase in breast size, redness, persistent itching, skin hot to touch. IBC often initially resembles mastitis.Only about 50-75% cases have the typical presentation. Symptoms can be completely atypical such as acute central venous thrombosis as the sole presenting symptom.IBC makes up only a small percentage of breast cancer cases (1-6% in the USA). IBC is often diagnosed in younger women although average age of presentation does not differ much from other kinds of breast cancer (average age 57 years). African-Americans are usually diagnosed at younger ages than Caucasian women, and also have a higher risk of getting IBC. Recent advances in therapy have improved the prognosis considerably and at least one third of women will survive the diagnosis by 10 years or longer.

1242200	Location,Place,PopulatedPlace,Settlement	Kafarakab (Arabic: ) (also spelled Kfarakab or Kfar Akab and pronounced "Kfara-ab" in Arabic) is the francophone spelling of the name of a scenic village in the mountains of Lebanon.  In Arabic, it means the home (Kfar: ) of the hawk (Akab: ). The village, which is located in the Matn District of the Mount Lebanon Governorate, is of particular significance because it is one of the various historic points of origin of the well known Maalouf family. It was founded c. 1560 AD when three families of the Maalouf clan, living at the time across the valley in the village of Mhaydse, received permission from the ruling emir to establish the village. The Maalouf family history is traced back to the very beginnings of Christianity in the Middle East beginning with the Ghassanid tribe, which converted to Christianity nearly 2,000 years ago.  The family name is now widespread worldwide.  Family lineages are detailed and well preserved, and conferences and a sense of family pride still preserve traditions, reunions, and culture.  The preservation effort has the intent of documenting every known person bearing the Maalouf name. All Maalouf families originate from KafarakabAside from this notoriety, the village is quaint and picturesque. It is of no great size, consisting of only a few dozen old homes built on terraced mountainsides lined with grape vineyards and many varieties of fruit trees. The population swells during the summer as people leave the heat of the Lebanese coastline for the freshness of the mountains. Its weather is moderate, with temperatures in ranging near 70 F (25 C) in the summer, and near 30 F (0 C) in the winter season. Snowfall is common in the winter, with snow accumulations reaching 3 to 4 feet (1 meter).The population follows the Christian faith, divided between Antiochian Orthodox and Melkite. The local St. Mary church is separated into two halves, one for each faith. The breathtaking view is perhaps the most impressive aspect of this red terra cotta rooftop cluster - including a view of the snow-capped Lebanon mountains to the east, and the Mediterranean sea and the city of Beirut to the west.  The village sits at an elevation about 3,600 ft. (1,100 m) just below the village of Baskinta and the towering Mount Sannine. Its distance to Beirut is approximately 40 km, or approximately 1 hour of driving. Its GPS coordinates are 335649N 354428EIt is truly one of those small places from which a great diaspora has influenced the world. From Kfarakab, the Maalouf clan migrated within Lebanon to Zahle and Niha in the Bekaa Valley where it became one of the most prominent families in these villages. The migration continued in the late 1800s and 1900s to Brazil, the United States of America and Canada where the family prospered and has become known in many spheres of influence.

1325780	Other	Lamin-B1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the LMNB1 gene.The nuclear lamina consists of a two-dimensional matrix of proteins located next to the inner nuclear membrane. The lamin family of proteins make up the matrix and are highly conserved in evolution. During mitosis, the lamina matrix is reversibly disassembled as the lamin proteins are phosphorylated. Lamin proteins are thought to be involved in nuclear stability, chromatin structure and gene expression. Vertebrate lamins consist of two types, A and B. This gene encodes one of the two B type proteins, B1.  Lamin B, along with heterochromatin, is anchored  to the inner surface of the nuclear membrane by the lamin B receptor.
1326403	Work	LaNet-vi is an open-source network visualization software. It is an acronym that stands for Large Networks visualization Tool.LaNet-vi is based on the k-core decomposition of a network. This decomposition was introduced by Seidman  in 1983 and divides the network in layers (the cores) thus providing a centrality measure for nodes. One of its main applications is the study of the Internet topology. Usually, the nodes in the highest cores of the Internet are densely connected between them, and serve as hubs for assuring the connectivity between peripheral nodes. The relationship between k-cores and connectivity has been studied by Havlin et al.  and Alvarez-Hamelin et al..The software was developed by Jose Ignacio Alvarez-Hamelin (University of Buenos Aires), Alain Barrat (CNRS), Alessandro Vespignani (Indiana University), Luca Dall'Asta (Politecnico di Torino) and Mariano Beiro (University of Buenos Aires).An online interface of the software is also available. This online version is being hosted and maintained by University of Buenos Aires.In November 2010 a visualization obtained with LaNet-vi appeared in the cover of Nature Physics.

1333468	Agent	Lai Choi San (Mountain of Wealth) was a 20th-century Chinese pirate. The only evidence of her existence is the book I Sailed With Pirates by Aleko Lilius, published in 1930. She was claimed Template:By whom? to be the most powerful and well-known female pirate leader in Chinese history, rivaled perhaps only by Cheng I Sao of the previous century, commanding a fleet of some 12 junks in the area of Macao and the South China Sea during the 1920s and 30s. Though her fleet was based in South China Sea, she frequented the East China Sea and sometimes the Sulu Sea near PalawanLai Choi San was one of several pirates that Lilius claims to have traveled with during the late 1920s. Lilius describes her fleet as "twelve smooth-bore, medieval-looking cannons onboard, and two rather modern ones. Along the bulwarks of the junk were bolted rows of heavy iron plates". Her crew are referred to as ladrones by the Portuguese and, according to Lilius, were "all fearsome fellows, muscular bare-chested men who wore wide-brimmed hats and tied red kerchiefs around their necks and heads". Lai Choi San has been referred to as a female "Robin Hood" figure, however she and her crew were often paid protection money by local merchants and operated with little interference from either Portuguese or Chinese authorities since inheriting the fleet from her father upon his death.Lai Choi San was the model for the Dragon Lady, one of the main villains which appeared in the comic, radio and television series Terry and the Pirates. The series creator Milton Caniff later claimed to have been inspired by reading a story about her. The character would heavily influence the stock character whose persona is usually portrayed as a beautiful yet cold-hearted villainess as seen in later popular culture.

1579034	Animal,Eukaryote,Species	Mongolosaurus is a genus of sauropod dinosaur which lived during the Early Cretaceous of China. In 1928 a team from the American Museum of Natural History, headed by Roy Chapman Andrews, at On Gong Gol near Hukongwulong in Inner Mongolia, in Quarry 714 discovered a sauropod tooth. In 1933 Charles W. Gilmore, based on this fossil, named and described the type species Mongolosaurus haplodon. The generic name refers to Mongolia. The specific name is derived from Greek haploos, "single", and odon, "tooth".The holotype, AMNH 6710, was found in the On Gong Formation of which the stratification is uncertain but which dates from the Lower Cretaceous. It consists of aforesaid tooth. Other remains from the same site have been referred to the species: about half a dozen teeth of the same type, a basioccipital from the back of the skull and parts of the first three cervical vertebrae. The teeth are long and cylindrical. Some other similar teeth from Asia have later been referred. The relationship of Mongolosaurus to other sauropods is problematic, with some authors listing it as a nomen dubium. It likely belonged to the general Neosauropoda. Having in the past been assigned to the Diplodocidae, Titanosauridae or Euhelopodinae, it is today considered a member of the Nemegtosauridae.

1606695	Agent,Person	Murshid Quli Khan (Bengali:   ) was the first Nawab of Bengal. In fact circumstances resulted in his being the first independent ruler of Bengal post the death of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Though he continued to recognize the nominal overlordship of the Mughal Emperor, for all practical purposes he was the Nawab of Bengal.Nothing is much certain about his family. The first version states that the founder of the Nasiri dynasty of Nawabs of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan, before being sold into slavery was bought by Haji Shafi Isfahani, a high ranking Mughal officer from Iran who educated him. After returning to India he entered the Mughal service. Aurangzeb made Murshid Quli Kahn the governor of Bengal in 1717 AD after converting him to Islam under the title of Kartalab Khan (The seeker of challenges). Another version is that he was the grandson of the Maratha general, Muhammad Quli Khan, (formerly known as Netaji Palkar) by his wife, Nusrat Banu, who was the daughter of Mughal Wazir, Asad Khan and was Iranian. But the most common version is that Murshid Quli Khan was born a poor Deccani Oriya Brahmin before being sold into slavery and bought by one Haji Shafi Isfahani, a Persian merchant from Isfahan who converted him to Islam and renamed him as Muhammad Hadi or Mirza Hadi and later entered the service of Haji Abdullah Khurasani, Diwan of the Berar province which was changed to a royal service by Aurangzeb.

1645084	Location,Place,PopulatedPlace	Nepal (/npl/ n-PAWL; Nepali:  [nepal] (13px )), officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, is a landlocked country located in South Asia. With an area of 147,181 square kilometres (56,827 sq mi) and a population of approximately 27 million, Nepal is the world's 93rd largest country by land mass and the 41st most populous country. It is located in the Himalayas and bordered to the north by the People's Republic of China, and to the south, east, and west by the Republic of India. Specifically, the Indian states of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, and Sikkim border Nepal, whereas across the Himalayas lies the Tibet Autonomous Region. Nepal is separated from Bangladesh by the narrow Indian Siliguri Corridor. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest metropolis.The mountainous north of Nepal has eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including the highest point on Earth, Mount Everest, called Sagarmatha () in the Nepali language. More than 240 peaks over 20,000 ft (6,096 m) above sea level are located in Nepal. The southern Terai region is fertile and humid.Hinduism is practiced by about 81.3% of Nepalis, making it the country with the highest percentage of Hindus. Buddhism is linked historically with Nepal and is practiced by 9%, Islam by 4.4%, Kiratism 3.1%, Christianity 1.4%, and animism 0.4%. A large portion of the population, especially in the hill region, may identify themselves as both Hindu and Buddhist, which can be attributed to the syncretic nature of Hinduism and Buddhism in Nepal.A monarchy throughout most of its history, Nepal was ruled by the Shah dynasty of kings from 1768  when Prithvi Narayan Shah unified its many small kingdoms  until 2008. A decade-long Civil War involving the Communist Party of Nepal and several weeks of mass protests by all major political parties led to the 12-point agreement of 22 November 2005. The ensuing elections for the 1st Nepalese Constituent Assembly on 28 May 2008 overwhelmingly favored the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a federal multiparty representative democratic republic.The political parties of Nepal agreed to form an interim government under the leadership of Chief Justice Khil Raj Regmi in order to hold elections for the Constituent Assembly by 19 November 2013 to end a political deadlock. The election was held successfully and the 2nd Nepalese Constituent Assembly was sworn in, with Sushil Koirala appointed as the new prime minister.In 2014, Nepal ranked 145th of 187 countries on the Human Development Index (HDI) and despite several challenges, Nepal has been making steady progress and the Government of Nepal has made a commitment to help the nation to graduate from the least developed country status by 2022.

1646844	Agent,Person,Other	Nestorius (/nstris/; in Greek: ; c. 386  450) was Archbishop of Constantinople from 10 April 428 until August 431, when the emperor Theodosius II confirmed his condemnation by the Council of Ephesus on 22 June.His teachings included a rejection of the long-used title of Theotokos, "Mother of God", for Mary, mother of Jesus, and were misunderstood by many to imply that he did not believe that Christ was truly God. This brought him into conflict with other prominent churchmen of the time, most notably Cyril of Alexandria, whom he accused of heresy.Nestorius sought to defend himself at the First Council of Ephesus in 431, but instead he found himself formally condemned for heresy by a majority of the bishops and subsequently removed from his see. On his own request he retired to his former monastery in or near Antioch. In 435 Theodosius II sent him into exile in Upper Egypt, where he lived on until 450, strenuously defending his orthodoxy. His last major defender within the Roman Empire, Theodoret of Cyrrhus, finally agreed to anathematize him in 451 during the Council of Chalcedon; from then on he had no defenders within the empire. But the Church of the East never accepted his condemnation. This led later to western Christians giving the name Nestorian Church to the Church of the East, even though it never regarded him as an authoritative teacher. The discovery and publication of his Book of Heraclides at the beginning of the 20th century led to a reassessment of his theology in western scholarship. It is now generally agreed that his ideas were not far from those that eventually emerged as orthodox, but the orthodoxy of his formulation of the doctrine of Christ is still controversial. This is due to the fact that the Second Council of Constantinople of AD 553 confirmed the validity of the condemnation of Nestorius, refuting the letter of Ibas that affirms that Nestorius was condemned without the due inquiry.

Initially, it was a connector between then-NY 72 in Nicholville and US 11 in Lawrenceville. The route was extended west to Potsdam by 1931 and rerouted to run from Nicholville to Malone c.1938. The latter realignment supplanted New York State Route 187, an eastwest highway assigned in 1930 that initially extended from Nicholville to North Bangor but was later realigned to serve Malone.

1673337	Agent,Artist,Person	Noel Thomas David Gallagher (born 29 May 1967) is an English musician, singer, and songwriter. He served as the lead guitarist, co-lead vocalist and principal songwriter of the rock band Oasis. Raised in Burnage, Manchester, Gallagher began learning guitar at the age of thirteen. After a series of odd jobs in construction, he worked for local Manchester band Inspiral Carpets as a roadie and technician in 1988. Whilst touring with them, he learned that his brother Liam Gallagher had formed a band of his own, known as the Rain, which eventually took on the name Oasis. After Gallagher returned to England, he was invited by his brother to join Oasis as songwriter and guitarist.Oasis' debut album, Definitely Maybe (1994), marked the beginning of the band's rise to fame as part of the Britpop movement. Oasis' second album, (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995), reached the top of the album charts in many countries and their third studio album, Be Here Now (1997), became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history. Britpop eventually declined in popularity and Oasis' next two albums failed to revive it. However, the band's final two albums, Don't Believe the Truth (2005) and Dig Out Your Soul (2008), were hailed as its best efforts in over a decade and found renewed success. On 28 August 2009, following an altercation with Liam prior to a gig in Paris, Gallagher announced his departure from Oasis and on 23 October 2009, he confirmed he would embark on a solo career. Gallagher would go on to form Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds.Gallagher's run with Oasis was marked by turbulence, especially during the peak of Britpop, during which he was involved in several disputes with Liam, and the brothers' fights and wild lifestyles regularly made headlines in British tabloid newspapers. Gallagher (along with Oasis) also shared a personal rivalry with fellow Britpop band Blur. However, he was often regarded as the spear-head of the Britpop movement, and at one point of time, NME  termed a number of Britpop bands (including Kula Shaker, Ocean Colour Scene and Cast) as "Noelrock", citing Gallagher's influence on their success. Many have praised Gallagher's songwriting, with George Martin claiming him to be 'the finest songwriter of his generation'.

1678013	Animal,Eukaryote,Species	The North African elephant (Loxodonta africana pharaoensis) was the subspecies of the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), or possibly a separate elephant species, that existed in North Africa north of the Sahara until becoming extinct in Ancient Roman times. These were the famous war elephants used by Carthage in the Punic Wars, their conflict with the Roman Republic. Although the subspecies has been formally described, it has not been widely recognized by taxonomists. Other names for this animal include the North African forest elephant, Carthaginian elephant, and Atlas elephant. Originally, its natural range probably extended across North Africa and down to the present Sudanese and Eritrean coasts.

1685796	Location,Place,PopulatedPlace,Settlement	Nowe Brzesko [nv bsk] is a town in Proszowice County, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, in southern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Nowe Brzesko. It lies approximately 10 kilometres (6 mi) south-east of Proszowice and 33 km (21 mi) east of the regional capital Krakow. Nowe Brzesko has an approximate population of 1,700. It gained town rights in 1279, but lost that status in 1870 by decree of the Russian tsar. It became a town again on 1 January 2011.Nowe Brzesko was first mentioned in the first half of the 13th century. The village belonged to the Bishops of Krakow, who handed it to the Norbertine abbey from nearby Hebdow. On October 6, 1279, it became a town, and its first known wojt was Gotfryd, the son of Arnold from Slesin in Greater Poland. Due to several privileges, the town quickly developed, but in the first half of the 15th century it declined, due to a catastrophic flood of the Vistula (1442). Furthermore, in 1444-45 it was ransacked by the unpaid royal soldiers, returning to Poland after the defeat in the Battle of Varna. As a result, Nowe Brzesko, while still a town, did not differ from local villages. Artisans were few, and fairs were not organized. In 1522, King Zygmunt Stary ordered local authorities to mark boundaries of Nowe Brzesko, and create a street system, together with a market place. Towns residents were in constant conflict with abbots from Hebdow, who tried to get rid of their privileges. In the late 16th century, the population of Nowe Brzesko was app. 1,000. The town slowly developed, but wars of the mid-17th century (see Swedish invasion of Poland) completely destroyed it and decimated the population. Polish, Swedish, Tatar and Transilvanian soldiers stayed here, robbing and stealing. Poverty and hunger were common, and the population declined by 50%. Furthermore, conflicts with the Hebdow abbots did not end, and residents of the town were forced to work for the abbey (see Serfdom). In 1761, a group of inhabitants rebelled against the authority of the abbot, and asked King Stanisaw August Poniatowski to support them. In the late 18th century (see Partitions of Poland), Nowe Brzesko was annexed by the Austrian Empire (1795). In 1815, it became part of the Russian-controlled Congress Poland. In 1818, the abbey was dissolved, and the town, with its 151 houses and 900 residents, became state property. Located away from main roads, near the border with Austrian Galicia, the town lost its charter in 1869, becoming a village. In the Second Polish Republic, it belonged to Kielce Voivodeship. Nowe Brzesko once again became a town in 2011.

1714220	Work,WrittenWork	Ontogeny and Phylogeny is Stephen Jay Gould's first technical book, published in 1977 by Belknap, a division of Harvard University Press. Gould wrote that Ernst Mayr suggested in passing that he write the book, but that "I only began it as a practice run to learn the style of lengthy exposition before embarking on my magnum opus about macroevolution." This became The Structure of Evolutionary Theory, published in 2002.Ontogeny and Phylogeny explores the relationship between embryonic development (ontogeny) and biological evolution (phylogeny). The book also discusses the role recapitulationErnst Haeckel's discredited idea that embryonic developmental stages replay the evolutionary transitions of adult forms of an organism's past descendantshad on biology, theology, and psychology. The second half of the book details how modern concepts such as heterochrony (changes in developmental timing) and neoteny (the retardation of developmental expression or growth rates) have in influencing macroevolution (major evolutionary transitions).It has been said that of all the books that Gould wrote in his career, "the one with the most impact is probably Ontogeny and Phylogeny ... to say that this work is a hallmark in this area of evolutionary theory would be an understatement. It proved to be the catalyst for much of the future work in the field, and to a large degree was the inspiration for the modern field of 'evolutionary developmental biology'. Gould's hope was to show that the relationship between ontogeny and phylogeny is fundamental to evolution, and at its heart is a simple premisethat variations in the timing and rate of development provide the raw material upon which natural selection can operate."

W. McArthur.  He wrote, "An old bridge. Chords badly worm eaten.  Downstream chord has been reinforced in middle by a timber bolted on.  Wood is but little better than a powder from worm action.  All signs indicate a new bridge in from 2 to 4 years."George W. Breeding constructed the present bridge at the same site in 1921 for $3,617, equivalent to $47.8 thousand today.

He was born in Deptford, London.Pat Houlihan is the only Crucible player never to have contested a best-of-19 match.He turned professional in 1971 at the age of 42 after many years as an amateur including beating future world champion John Spencer 11-3 at Blackpool Tower during the 1965 World Amateur Championship. Additionally, he lifted the BA&CC television tournament, one of snooker's first televised events.During his professional career his highest position in the world rankings was 18th, which he reached in 1979. His highest break at the televised stages of the World Championship played at the Crucible was 83. He played in the main stages of the World Championship twice: in 1973 when he lost to then defending champion Alex Higgins, and at the Crucible in 1978 when he lost to Cliff Thorburn in the first round. He retired in 1993 and vanished from the game.His early career had been stymied by world champion turned snooker star, Joe Davis, who was responsible for selecting new professionals and disapproved of amateurs such as Houlihan who had played matches at various snooker clubs for money. Despite his cult status, there was no braggadocio about Patsy's manner, which was always modest and unassuming. He was also a mesmerising storyteller, possessing a vast store of snooker-related anecdotes, as well as a dazzling repertoire of coin tricks.Patsy had a cameo role in Les Reid's 1984 film- Number One -playing the part of Pete Phelan. It starred Bob Geldof and Mel Smith.He was married with three grown-up children. His friend, Jimmy White now a snooker legend himself, once described him as "the greatest snooker player I've ever seen", and White's own brand of attacking snooker owed much to his fellow south Londoner. Jimmy White has rated Charlie Poole, Patsy Houlihan and Alex Higgins as the three greatest snooker players he has ever seen, reasoning that they were "Potters and entertainers. Safety shots were too boring for them."Warren King: " I think Patsy was still playing in pro events when I first started playing on the tour in the early eighties. I did not really know him, but he was a great character and player in his time."Frank Sandell: "I only met him a couple of times, though his reputation as both, a superb player and character, was without question.""He did an exhibition for a children's charity, in around 1981, and was brilliant with the kids.He played at Rommiley Forum- Stockport- in the World qualifiers, in the last time I saw him. I don't think he could afford a hotel, so he bunked down on a fellow player's bedroom floor." "He was full of amazing stories about the game and of East End life."Houlihan beat Reardon 6-5 in the English amateur semi, after trailing 5-1. Reardon, whose full-time job was a policeman at the time, lamented 'I should be locked up... " - Paul Smith.Mike Wilson: Its a shame there is no television footage of Patsy. My old man (Cliff Wilson) told me Patsy was a joy to watch.Ann-Marie Farren, former ladies World Champion: I played Patsy in Leigh-on-Sea once and he was only allowed to pot the yellow as a colour. He was such a nice bloke. I will take a look at your page to the great man. Later, Houlihan beat John Spencer 11-3 to win the 1965 English Amateur Championship but was blocked from turning professional for several more years. Spencer was invited instead to compete in the world championships in Karachi as Patsy had a previous engagement: four months in Wormwood Scrubs for breaking into a warehouse.

According to a criminal complaint filed in the Middle District of North Carolina, Miller borrowed $13,750 in federally insured student loans in 1980 when he was a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.By March 2004, Miller had paid back just $1,700, according to the complaint, and his loan balance had increased to $23,378 with penalties and interest.In December 2004, Miller learned that the government would begin garnishing his wages, so he offered to make monthly payments of $200 to the U.S. Department of Education, the complaint said.Four months later, Miller sent several letters to the garnishment branch of the Department of Education claiming that he had paid the debt in full in 1992 and enclosing copies of five canceled checks from 1992 totaling $20,500.The education department researched the checks and found that instead of being written for $4,100 each as Miller claimed, they had been written for $100 each. Further, the government found that Miller only owed $14,361 in June 1992, not the more than $20,000 he said he had paid.When confronted in Atlanta with the copies of the checks archived by the Department of Education, Miller did not admit guilt but agreed to participate in an investigation, the complaint said.In December 2006, Miller was sentenced to a year's probation and fined $1,000 by a federal judge. After pleading guilty in September 2006 to falsely claiming he paid more than $20,000, a second chargethat he altered checks to support his claimwas dismissed in an agreement with prosecutors. [1]

1908297	ArchitecturalStructure,Infrastructure,Location,Place	Redbank Power Station is located near Singleton, in the Hunter Region, New South Wales, Australia. It is coal powered with one steam driven turbo generator with a capacity of 151 MW of electricity. Originally Redbank Power Station was promoted as being at the cutting edge of environmental technology, but has been criticised by environmentalists for producing more CO2 than other types of coal-fired power station. The first stage of the Redbank project was taken to the Land and Environment Court in 1994 over claims by environmentalists that it did not meet its own standards. The claim was dismissed by the court.Redbank draws its cooling water from the Hunter River.Redbank is fuelled by beneficiated, dewatered tailings from the Mount Thorley Warkworth mine at Warkworth, delivered by conveyor. In lay terms this is the part of the coal waste which would otherwise not be utilised, and simply buried as the mines progress.According to Carbon Monitoring for Action (CARMA), in 2007 Redbank emitted more climate change and global warming causing greenhouse gases per unit of electricity generated than any other power station in Australia. However no data from the actual plant, operator or Australian Government is actually used to base these approximate assumptions on. CARMA uses a statistical model that predicts CO2 emissions given the size, age, fuel type, estimated capacity utilization, and engineering specifications of individual plants.Carbon Monitoring for Action estimates this power station emits 1.06 million tonnes of greenhouse gases each year as a result of burning coal. The Australian Government has announced the introduction of a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme commencing in 2010 to help combat climate change. It is expected to impact on emissions from power stations.

1908563	Animal,Eukaryote,Species	The redeye gaper, Chaunax stigmaeus, is a sedentary species of anglerfish in the family Chaunacidae. It is native to deep waters in the western North Atlantic from the Georges Bank off New England southward to the Blake Plateau off South Carolina. The species is found on the outer continental shelf and upper continental slope at a depth of 90730 m and among dense beds of dead coral (Lophelia pertusa) rubble, their preferred habitat. The original type specimen was caught in a trawl off Atlantic City on March 1, 1946, and donated to the Academy of Natural Sciences by Carroll B. Atkinson. The name stigmaeus means "speckled" in Greek.The redeye gaper has a rounded, slightly compressed body and a very large head. The mouth is large, with a protruding lower jaw and teeth arranged in bands. The skin is soft, loose, and very pliable (especially on the underside), forming folds over much of the head and body. The fish is covered with minute spinules that give it a velvety texture. The lateral line system has prominent open canals. The pectoral fins are small, with 14 fin rays. The first dorsal fin ray is modified into an angling apparatus (the illicium) with a lure (the esca). The esca consists of a cluster of filaments of varying thickness and is black to blue to greenish gray in front, and brilliant white behind. The illicium has two dark rings, though this is faint or absent in a few individuals.The coloration is olive green above with large irregular blotches surrounded by smaller circular spots, extending into the rays of the dorsal, pectoral, and caudal fins. There is often a kidney- or figure-8-shaped blotch on the nape. These spots appear darker than the background in preserved specimens, but are a lighter greenish-yellow color in life. The underside is rose-colored with large, diffuse lighter patches; the red color extends up the sides of the head forward of the eyes, encompassing the jaws. The fin membranes are also shades of red. The iris is a deep rose red. This species attains a maximum of 30.5 cm total length.Redeye gapers are sedentary ambush predators that spend most of their time resting on the sea floor on their pectoral and pelvic fins, moving only to capture prey or avoid predators. They attract prey to them using their movable esca. If threatened, they raise themselves up on their pelvic fins and rapidly take in water to increase the size of their bodies. Redeye gapers are known to be able to survive the temperature and pressure changes from being brought to the surface.

1968731	Agent	Ronald (Victor) Conway (4 May 1927 - 16 March 2009) was an Australian therapist and author, best known for his sociological works of the 1970s and 1980s, including The Great Australian Stupor, which sold exceptionally well (70,000 copies, a very impressive total by Australian standards), and The Land of the Long Weekend (1978). Among other books by him were The End of Stupor? (1984), Being Male (1985), The Rage for Utopia (1994) and a memoir, Conway's Way (1988).Conway started off in life working in a book store and progressing to electrical fitting in the Royal Australian Air Force during the Second World War. A native of Melbourne, Conway was employed as a psychologist by St Vincent's Hospital in that city from 1961 until his retirement. He also maintained a busy private practice at his home in the Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn specialising in male difficulties and personal issues.Many of Conway's articles appeared in The Age, The Australian, Quadrant, and the now defunct National Times. He had a long-standing association with the National Civic Council (NCC), led by right-wing Catholic activist B. A. Santamaria; at times Santamaria published Conway in the NCC's flagship journal, News Weekly. This association ended when an impassioned censure by Conway of the NCC, particularly concerning the issues of contraception, homosexuality and the parameters of papal infalibility ("Mr Santamaria - And Goodbye To All That", Quadrant, December 1990), led to a lasting estrangement between the two men. Conway also regretted the 1980s' split in the NCC that saw industrial elements of the organisation ejected. He believed Santamaria to have been the guiding force behind the split.Conway also worked as a consultant for the Melbourne Catholic archdiocese, assessing seminary candidates. His admirers included Tony Abbott, Prime Minister from September 2013 (and Catholic). In his books and essays (as the above-mentioned reference to the Quadrant piece implies) Conway questioned Catholic teaching on sexual matters, allying himself with Freud, with Jung (both Freud and Jung are openly praised in The Great Australian Stupor as great pioneers in the study of the human psyche)  and, periodically, with Eastern mysticism. This was chiefly because of Conway's interest in world religions and human belief systems in general. He emphasized the importance of wider human experience as an antidote to the `psychophobia' present in so many public exchanges. Conway questioned the validity of Catholic teaching on artificial contraception, pointing to the misery of Africa and South America and maintaining that women had the right to regulate the size of their families in an acceptable fashion. He saw contraception as a "morally neutral" issue that the Church had no reason or right on which to opine. He also believed the Church over-emphasised sexual sin above all others which bemused him.One staunch defence of Freud by Conway was an article published in The Australian on 22 June 1994: "Integrity Attack Ignores Fruit of Freud's Genius". Conway also praised the psychotherapeutic use of LSD in the 1960s and 1970s, under the guidance of trained practitioners, and was critical of its withdrawal from use in the early 1970s. In his opinion the ban on LSD was caused largely by the questionable professional machinations of  Timothy Leary in the US. Conway was also friends with Professor Stanislave Grof, an early pioneer in the use of LSD as an aid in his consulting practice. He never changed his opinion that LSD was the most useful tool available for psychotherapists. Politically Conway saw himself as an "old-time Whig conservative" with "gnostic" leanings and professionally "eclectic". Others saw him broadly as a neo-Freudian.After the 1996 accession to Melbourne's archiepiscopate of George Pell, Conway grew less prominent in the media, although now and then he wrote for the Sydney Catholic magazine Annals Australasia, and Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper, as well as having periodically appeared on television.Conway died in St Vincent's Hospital itself, after suffering from Parkinson's disease and peripheral brain damage. He was farewelled in a Requiem Mass at St Patrick's Cathedral, attended by many prominent friends and former clients. His ashes were then interred at the cemetery of Brighton (a Melbourne suburb) alongside the remains of his parents. Following his death, evidence that he had sexually interfered with certain male patients was compiled and made public by the organisation Broken Rites.

2002661	Animal,Eukaryote,Species	The saffron finch  (Sicalis flaveola) is a tanager from South America that is common in open and semi-open areas in lowlands outside the Amazon Basin. They have a wide distribution in Colombia, northern Venezuela (where it is called "canario de tejado" or "roof canary"), western Ecuador, western Peru, eastern and southern Brazil (where it is called "canario da terra" or "native canary"), Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, northern Argentina, and Trinidad and Tobago. It has also been introduced to Hawaii, Puerto Rico and elsewhere. Although commonly regarded as a canary, it is not related to the Atlantic canary. Formerly, it was placed in the Emberizidae but it is close to the seedeaters. The male is bright yellow with an orange crown which distinguishes it from most other yellow finches (the exception being the orange-fronted yellow finch). The females are more confusing and are usually just a slightly duller version of the male, but in the southern subspecies S. f. pelzelni they are olive-brown with heavy dark streaks.Typically nesting in cavities, the saffron finch makes use of sites such as abandoned rufous hornero (Furnarius rufus) nests, bamboo branches and under house roofs - this species is tolerant of human proximity, appearing at suburban areas and frequenting bird tables.  They have a pleasant but repetitious song which, combined with their appearance, has led to them being kept as caged birds in many areas. Males are polygamous, mating with two females during the nesting season, and  territorial, which has led to the species being used for blood sporting with two males put in a cage in order to fight.

2081170	Agent	Shona Rapira Davies  (born 1951) is a Great Barrier Island-based sculptor and painter of Ngati Wai Maori descent. She first studied at the Auckland College of Education, majoring in art, and later in Dunedin at Otago Polytechnic, graduating with a Diploma in Fine Arts in 1983. In 1989 she was awarded the prestigious Frances Hodgkins Fellowship and a residency for indigenous artists at the Banff Centre of the Arts in Canada.She exhibits widely; both as a sculptor and as a painter. Rapira Davies is interested in the empowerment of Maori women in spite of perceived racism (in a Pakeha culture) and sexism (within the patriarchal structure of Maori tribal organisation). She uses her art work to make declamatory statements about perceived injustices against Maori.She is well known for her landscape sculpture commission for Te Aro Park (also called Pigeon Park) in central Wellington. The ceramic tile permanent work is considered one of New Zealand's most successful public sculptures. Set in a narrow triangle of public space with adjacent busy roads and much foot traffic it is a very visible work.One of Rapira Davies' major works, the sculptural installation Nga Morehu (1988), the title of which translates to 'the survivors', is held by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, along with preparatory drawings. The work was originally made for Whakamamae ('to feel pain'), an exhibition Rapira Davies had with painter Robyn Kahukiwa at the Wellington City Art Gallery in 1988. Nga Morehu pays tribute to the strength and resilience of Maori women. The work depicts the karanga, the call of welcome performed by women which begins ceremonial occasions, through a group of terracotta figures arranged on an unfinished whariki (woven flax mat). A naked female child faces a group of women advancing towards her, performing the karanga, and at the end of the mat is a seated kuia (female elder). The body of the child is adorned with the words of a contemporary poem and that of the kaikaranga (the women leading the karanga) with the words of a waiata (a song), while the other female forms carry racial slurs. Curator Megan Tamati-Quennell writes: Reflecting the rise of the political Maori voice and the place of feminism in New Zealand art at the time, Nga Morehu portrays the impact of colonisation on Maori culture and Maori women particularly.

In the valley of Iraca (or Sogamoso) the Sun was born. Sogamoso was a religious center of the Muiscas, Indians of the Cundinamarca and Boyaca highlands, as they reminds, it the  Archaeological Park  built in the place that occupied the necropolis  Temple of the Sun.The myth of Sugamuxi that recreates the origin of the two gods of the region of IracaRamiriqui and Iraca- was picked up by the chronist Father Pedro Simon in his  News Records of the New Reino of Granada , and the German countess summarizes this way, Gertrud von Podewils Durniz, in her work  Chigys Mie  (that means last Things in language music").It mentions "Darkness still continued reigning on the earth, and the men lived in eternal night. Iraca sent to Ramiriqui to heaven to enlighten the world, and called him Sua. But his clear light only shone by day, because running from one in the sky, the evening was hidden behind the hills, leaving the earth of the Chibcha plugged in the darkness and mourning. Seeing that, the lord of Iraca flew in person to the sky to give light on whether, and Chia calling shine at night when Shua hides. ' ".The chronist of Indias Lucas Fernandez of Piedrahita, describes this way to Sogamoso for the time of the Spanish conquest:It is almost entirely flat land, dilated in good proportion, and the best and more fertile the New Kingdom of Granada. Fertilize this province with its waters, and divide it in two parts, the brave river Sogamoso whose origin distributed the cities of Tunja and Toca, which recognizes its principles. This province runs for the slopes of the mountain range that it serves as boundary between the Plains and New Kingdom, with very healthy temple in which were populated different nations subject to Sogamoso, and the whole distance to reached all the way or reaching your lordship is the holy land called, dead in it, as they said, the first interpreter Bochica of their religion, leaving heirs of their power to the chiefs who succeeded him, although the Indians of that province referred to in the case of this.
2114432	Eukaryote,Species	The Solanaceae, or nightshades, are an economically important family of flowering plants. The family ranges from annual and perennial herbs to vines, lianas, epiphytes, shrubs, and trees, and includes a number of important agricultural crops, medicinal plants, spices, weeds, and ornamentals. Many members of the family contain potent alkaloids, and some are highly toxic, but many cultures eat nightshades, in some cases as staple foods. The family belongs to the order Solanales, in the asterid group dicotyledons (Magnoliopsida). The Solanaceae consists of about 98 genera and some 2,700 species, with a great diversity of habitats, morphology and ecology.The name Solanaceae derives from the genus Solanum, "the nightshade plant". The etymology of the Latin word is unclear. The name may come from a perceived resemblance of certain solanaceous flowers to the sun and its rays. At least one species of Solanum is known as the "sunberry". Alternatively, the name could originate from the Latin verb solari, meaning "to soothe", presumably referring to the soothing pharmacological properties of some of the psychoactive species of the family.The family has a worldwide distribution, being present on all continents except Antarctica. The greatest diversity in species is found in South America and Central America.The Solanaceae include a number of commonly collected or cultivated species. The most economically important genus of the family is Solanum, which contains the potato (S. tuberosum, in fact, another common name of the family is the "potato family"), the tomato (S. lycopersicum), and the eggplant or aubergine  (S. melongena). Another important genus, Capsicum, produces both chili peppers and bell peppers.The genus Physalis produces the so-called groundcherries, as well as the tomatillo (Physalis philadelphica), the Cape gooseberry  and the Chinese lantern.  The genus Lycium contains the boxthorns and the wolfberry Lycium barbarum.  Nicotiana contains, among other species, the plant that produces tobacco. Some other important members of Solanaceae include a number of ornamental plants such as Petunia, Browallia, and Lycianthes, the source of psychoactive alkaloids, Datura, Mandragora (mandrake), and Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade).  Certain species are universally known for their medicinal uses, their psychotropic effects, or for being poisonous.With the exception of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum, Nicotianoideae) and petunia (Petunia x hybrida, Petunioideae), most of the economically important genera are contained in the subfamily Solanoideae. Finally, but not less importantly, the Solanaceae include many model organisms which are important in the investigation of fundamental biological questions at  cellular, molecular, and genetic levels, such as tobacco and the petunia.

The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is the agency in charge.The wilderness is broken into two sections. The Red Mountain unit is dominated by Red Mountain and the Cedar Creek (South Fork Eel River) drainage.  Elevations range from 1,100 feet at the southwest end along Cedar Creek to 4,083 feet, less than three miles away at the top Red Mountain.  Terrain is generally steep, consisting of rugged drainages dropping abruptly into Cedar Creek canyon.  A small area of fairly gentle slopes is found near the summit.  A zone of reddish soil occupies the central part of the area and contrasts sharply with the surrounding landscape.  These unusual soils have resulted in a unique vegetation cover of several species of pine and cypress trees intermixed with a low brush understory.  Rare and endangered plant species occupy the landscape covered by these ultrabasic soils. These rare plants have been isolated over space and time on serpentine rock near the summit of Red Mountain. This edaphic sky island holds the northern range extension of Sargent cypress (Cupressus sargentii). This a is also the only location to find Red Mountain buckwheat (Eriogonum kelloggii) and Red Mountain stonecrop (Sedum eastwoodiae.

2128222	Animal,Eukaryote,Species	Sparassodonta is an extinct order of carnivorous metatherian mammals native to South America. They were once considered to be true marsupials, but are now thought to be a sister taxon to them.REDIRECT Template:Unreliable source?This is a redirect from a page that has been moved (renamed). This page was kept as a redirect to avoid breaking links, both internal and external, that may have been made to the old page name.  For more information follow the category link. A number of these mammalian predators closely resemble placental predators that evolved separately on other continents, and are cited frequently as examples of convergent evolution. They were first described by Florentino Ameghino, from fossils found in the Santa Cruz beds of Patagonia. Sparassodonts were present throughout South America's long period of "splendid isolation" during the Cenozoic; during this time they shared the niches for large warm-blooded predators with the flightless terror birds. Previously, it was thought that these mammals died out in the face of competition from "more competitive" placental carnivorans during the Pliocene Great American Interchange, but more recent research has showed that sparassodonts died out long before eutherian carnivores arrived in South America (aside from procyonids).

2131888	Animal,Eukaryote,Species	The Spinach (Eulithis mellinata) is a moth of the family Geometridae. It is found throughout much of the Palearctic region and the Near East though its distribution is rather local due to its specialized larval food plant. In the British Isles it is fairly common in England and Wales but much rarer in Scotland and Ireland.Its wingspan is 3338 mm. The forewings are yellow marked with brown fascia and apical streak with brown chequering on the fringe. The hindwings are plain cream but are rarely seen as the species usually rests in a very distinctive and characteristic way with the forewings held out at 90 to the body with the hindwings hidden behind them. Some other members of the genus such as Northern Spinach and Barred Straw rest in a similar way. The species flies at night from June to August  and is attracted to light.The larva is green with white lines and feeds exclusively on currant. The species overwinters as an egg. The flight season refers to the British Isles. This may vary in other parts of the range.

2133247	Work,WrittenWork	Spoilt Rotten: The Toxic Cult of Sentimentality (subtitle in US editions:  How Britain is Ruined by Its Children) is a non-fiction book by the British writer and retired doctor and psychiatrist Theodore Dalrymple, originally published in 2010. Polemical in nature, the book contends that sentimentality has become culturally entrenched in British society, with harmful consequences. The author uses a range of cultural, educational, political, media and literary issuesincluding falling standards in education, UK aid policies for African development, the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, and the work and life of Sylvia Plathto illustrate what he sees as the danger of abandoning logic in favour of sentimentality, which he describes as "the progenitor, the godparent, the midwife of brutality". Much of Dalrymple's analysis is underpinned by his experience of working with criminals and the mentally ill. Spoilt Rotten received a mostly favourable reception in the media. Dalrymple was praised for carrying out a thought-provoking and convincing analysis of a newly emerged cultural phenomenon which sees emotion substituted for reason. Some critics, however, accused the author of cynicism and misanthropic pessimism in his approach, and the historian Noel Malcolm claimed that Dalrymple had overreached in his analysis.

2146031	Eukaryote,Species	Stanhopea (J. Frost ex Hook. 1829) is a genus of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) from Central and South America. The abbreviation used in horticultural trade is Stan. The genus is named for the 4th Earl of Stanhope (Philip Henry Stanhope) (1781-1855), president of the Medico-Botanical Society of London (1829-1837). These epiphytic, but occasionally terrestrial  orchids can be found in damp forests from Mexico to NW Argentina. Their ovate pseudobulbs carry from the top one long, plicate, elliptic leaf.Stanhopea is noted for its complex and usually fragrant flowers that are generally spectacular and short-lived. Their pendant inflorescences are noted for flowering out of the bottom of the containers in which they grow, lending themselves to culture in baskets that have enough open space for the infloresence push through. They are sometimes called upside-down orchids.Primitive StanhopeasMost Stanhopea flowers flash prominent, elegant horns on the epichile. The exception are the species; S. annulata, S. avicula, S. cirrhata, S. ecornuta and S. pulla. A second group have short or truncated horns, they include the species; S. candida, S. grandiflora, S. reichenbachiana, S. tricornis and the natural hybrid S. x herrenhusana. The structure of the labellum of this group is in general, not as complex as other members of the genus.With most Stanhopea flowers lasting three days or less, the flowers must attract pollinators very quickly. These chemical attractants are generated in the hypochile, attracting the male euglossine bees to the flower. When the bee touches down on the flower, a great effort is made to collect chemical scent - he eventually slides on the waxy surface of the hypochile, gliding down on the slippery lip to exit the flower. The long column is touched in the process, resulting in the bee taking up pollinia at the very tip of the column. When the bee slides down another flower, the pollinia are deposited on the sticky surface of the stigma.The majority of species are robust plants that grow readily in cultivation. For relatives of Stanhopea see Stanhopeinae and the closely related sister subtribe Coeliopsidinae..

He was a bay colt sired by Longstreet out of the mare Stone Nellie (by imported Stonehenge). His grandsire was the great racer and top nineteenth century sire Longfellow, himself a son of the important foundation sire Leamington. Stone Street was bred by noted horseman James Ben Ali Haggin, who had won the Derby in 1886 with his entry Ben Ali. Stone Street has also been called Stonestreet in other racing publications and is named after a combination of his sire and dam's names.Stone Street's Derby win, under jockey Arthur Pickens, is notable because the colt had not won any major stakes races before the Derby and did not win another major stakes race in his entire six year racing career after the Derby.[1] The 1908 Kentucky Derby was run on a wet track, with Stone Street easily creating an early lead over the other seven contenders, who were bogged down in the mud and were in poor racing form that day. The $5 minimum bet paid $123.60 to win for Stone Street at 24 to 1 final odds. [1] As of 2009, Stone Street's winning time of 2:15 1/5 is the slowest ever recorded at the Derby's current 1-1/4 mile distance. Stone Street was euthanized in January 1914 after becoming entangled in a wire fence. He had been gelded by the time of his death.

2193925	Work,Other	Sylvia Scarlett is a 1935 romantic comedy film starring Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant, based on The Early Life and Adventures of Sylvia Scarlett, a novel by Compton MacKenzie.  Directed by George Cukor, it was notorious as one of the most famous unsuccessful movies of the 1930s.  Hepburn plays the title role of Sylvia Scarlett, a female con artist masquerading as a boy to escape the police. The success of the subterfuge is in large part due to the transformation of Hepburn by RKO make-up artist Mel Berns.This film was the first pairing of Grant and Hepburn, who later starred together in Bringing Up Baby (1938), Holiday (1938), and The Philadelphia Story (1940).  Cary Grant's performance as a dashing rogue sees him incorporate a (rather unconvincing) Cockney accent and remains widely considered the first time Grant's famous personality began to register on film. (Grant only used the Cockney accent in a few other films, notably 1939's Gunga Din and Clifford Odets' None but the Lonely Heart in 1944.) Cockney was not, however, Cary Grant's original accent. He was born and grew up in Bristol, which has a very different accent from that of London, although it was much closer to Grant's pre-Hollywood accent than the voice he used in most films, an essentially successful product of his attempting to sound more American in order to broaden the range of roles for which he could be cast.

2219560	Location,NaturalPlace,Place	The Taylor Glacier is an Antarctic glacier about 54 kilometres (34 mi) long, flowing from the plateau of Victoria Land into the western end of Taylor Valley, north of the Kukri Hills, south of the Asgard Range. The middle part of the glacier is bounded on the north by the Inland Forts and on the south by Beacon Valley.The glacier was discovered by the British National Antarctic Expedition (190104) and at that time thought to be a part of Ferrar Glacier. The Western Journey Party of the British Antarctic Expedition 1910 determined that the upper and lower portions of what was then known as Ferrar Glacier are apposed, i.e., joined in Siamese-twin fashion north of Knobhead. With this discovery Scott named the upper portion for Griffith Taylor, geologist and leader of the Western Journey Party. The Taylor Glacier has been the focus of a measurement and modeling effort carried out by researchers from the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Texas at Austin.Like other glaciers in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Taylor Glacier is cold-based, meaning its bottom is frozen to the ground below. The rest of the worlds glaciers are wet-based, meaning they scrape over the bedrock, picking up and leaving obvious piles of debris (moraines) along their edges.Cold-based glaciers flow more like putty, pushed forward by their own weight. Cold-based glaciers pick up minimal debris, cause little erosion, and leave only small moraines. They also look different from above. Instead of having surfaces full of crevasses, cold-based glaciers are comparatively flat and smooth.

A studio audition led to the duo signing a record deal with Columbia Records, and the song was recorded in March 1964 at Columbia Studios in New York City. The album was a commercial failure and led to the duo breaking apart, with Simon returning to England and Garfunkel to his studies at Columbia University. In spring 1965, the song began to attract airplay at radio stations in Boston and Florida. The growing airplay led Tom Wilson, the song's producer, to remix the track, overdubbing electric instrumentation with the same musicians who backed Bob Dylan's "Like a Rolling Stone". Simon & Garfunkel were not informed of the song's remix until after its release. The single was released in September 1965 and immediately began climbing the charts. The song hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in December 1965, leading the duo to reunite and hastily record their second album, which CBS titled Sounds of Silence in an attempt to capitalize on the song's success. The song was a top ten hit in multiple countries worldwide, among them Australia, Austria, West Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Generally considered a classic folk rock song, the song was added to the National Recording Registry in the Library of Congress for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically important" in 2013.

2382740	Other	A urea transporter is a membrane transport protein, transporting urea. Humans and other mammals have two types of urea transport proteins, UT-A and UT-B. The UT-A proteins are important for renal urea handling and are produced by alternative splicing of the SLC14A2 gene.  Urea transport in the kidney is regulated by vasopressin.The structure of a urea transport family protein from Desulfovibrio vulgaris was determined by x-ray crystallography. The structure has a pathway through the membrane that is similar to that of ion channel proteins, accounting for the ability of urea transport proteins to move up to one million urea molecules per second across the membrane.Urea transporters can be inhibited by the action of urea analogues like thiourea and glycosides like phloretin. Their inhibition results in diuresis due to urea induced osmosis in the collecting ducts of the kidney.

2431357	Agent,Organisation,Other	WLAV-FM (96.9 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a classic rock music format in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  It is the dominant classic rock-formatted radio station in the market and is generally a top ten performer in the Grand Rapids ratings. WLAV-AM went on the air in 1940. In 1949, WLAV-TV 7 signed on, later becoming WOOD-TV 8. WLAV-FM began broadcasting by 1948.  The station was a simulcast of WLAV 1340 in its early days, but began to break the simulcast in the early 1970s to play AOR music at night.  In 1974, it became western Michigan's first full-time AOR station and was an instant success.The success lasted for a while, but in the mid-1980s, WLAV began to fall apart. The station was sued for the death of two people and the injury of two people at its popular raft race event. To make matters worse, many of WLAV's top D.J.s began to leave. Morning host Laurie DeYoung left for Baltimore, because she thought it was time to move on. Tony Gates also left, in 1984, after he ran into some trouble. In 1986 popular morning personality Kevin Matthews left to work in St. Louis. By the early 1990s, WLAV-FM had begun to tank in the ratings, thanks to increased competition from nascent album rocker WKLQ and classic rocker WJFM.  In the spring 1991 Arbitron report, WLAV, which had been a top five station just a year before and had been the #1 station 12+ as recently as fall 1987, fell completely out of the top ten stations 12+, its role as Grand Rapids' top album-rocker having been usurped by WKLQ.  On Memorial Day, 1991, the station changed to a modern rock-based format, since it felt that modern rock was the direction that progressive rock was heading in.  However, there was a considerable backlash and numerous complaints were received to the radio station because they eradicated a heritage format.  By the fall of 1992, WLAV switched back to a more classic rock-driven format and continued refining the format during the 1990s, to success in the ratings. Grand Rapids did get a modern rock station a few years later when WGRD-FM tweaked its format from Top 40 to modern rock.Citadel Broadcasting acquired the station from Bloomington Broadcasting (doing business as Michigan Media) in 2000. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011.

He spent three and a half years in prison as a conscientious objector during World War II, was on the first of the freedom rides (then called the Journey of Reconciliation) enforcing desegregation in 1947 and was the first national field organizer for the Congress of Racial Equality.In 1948, he began his lifelong relationship with Juanita, who met him while she was working as a journalist and went to interview him in jail.  Together, they began engaging in war tax resistance.  When we became tax resisters in 1948, they wrote, it included not filing, not answering notices to supply information and making sure we had something to refuse.Wally and Juanita Nelson spent a few months at the Koinonia Farm in 1957 and continued to work with that project for the next decade.Over time, the Nelsons came to adopt the income-reduction method of war tax refusal. Living on a reduced income is related to our refusal only as a progression of awareness, that our entire economic life is tied into violence. It seemed logical that the less we participated, the less wed be giving to that system.The Nelsons cut their expenses dramatically  building a house with salvaged materials and without electricity or plumbing, and growing the majority of their own food on a half-acre of land. Eventually they came to live on less than $5,000 per year. As they aged, they wrote, we may soon face some difficult decisions We have no insurance. In latter years weve had our share of medical problems. Hospitalizations are covered by aid to the indigent. We talk with doctors before they take us on. Mostly they dont charge; sometimes we agree on something up to twenty percent of the fee. Our greatest insurance has been the outpouring of support from many, many younger friends (and some older ones).Wally Nelson countered complaints about government with stern words about individual responsibility. After the Tiananmen Square massacre, he told a reporter: What happened in China last month was because you had people following orders. There was damn fools out there doing it. You got to have somebody take orders to do it. He added: I never accuse presidents of doing anything  we do it.For their role as farmers, civil rights activists, pacifists, war tax resisters, their love & generosity and their spirited life of service to the movements of social justice, activist nonviolence and peace, Wally Nelson and his wife, Juanita Nelson received the Courage of Conscience Award from The Peace Abbey in Sherborn, Massachusetts.Wally & Juanita were also founding members of the Valley Community Land Trust in western Massachusetts.  A no-interest loan fund is now held by the trust in Wally's memory.
